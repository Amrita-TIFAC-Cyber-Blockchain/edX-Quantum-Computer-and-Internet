This repository contains the materials and links which were explored and experimented for "**Architecture, Algorithms, and Protocols of a Quantum Computer and Quantum Internet**" Course as part of my Ph.D. Coursework (Aug, 2022 - Jan, 2023). 

## Terms

#### Entanglement

Entaglement is the special connection between two qubits. When these qubits are measured, they both yield the same results no matter how far they are. Properties of 
entaglement: monogamy of entaglement, maximal coordination.

#### Measurement

The act of observing the quantum state. 

#### Teleportation

Method to send qubits using tanglement.
